# Hogwarts_Sorting_Hat
My First App -
Hello everyone,
This is a Flutter application to find one's Hogwarts Houses - Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. It allows the user to select answers based on which it sorts them.The purpose behind building this application was covering a lot of concepts such as:

-Showing Widgets on the screen.
-Recycling Widgets.
-Changing Screens.
-Internal Logic.

## Features or Modules:

-Three multiple-choice questions ( more questions can be added ).
-Four selectable options for each question in the form of buttons except the last one.
-The score will be calculated based on the option selected for each question (Internally).
-And based on the final score a remark will be shown at the end of the quiz in addition to the score and restart button.
-There are two screens in the app home (where questions will be shown) and the result screen ( where score and remark will be shown).
-The whole app will be separated into five different modules namely main.dart, question.dart, answer.dart,quiz.dart and result.dart.
